            React describes itself as “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces”. 
            It’s an open-source library, which anyone can use to build applications or webpages. 
            What makes React special is that it has made it possible for apps and webpages 
            to change the information which the user sees without having to constantly reload 
            or rewrite the page. This makes React quick and popular for companies such as 
            Instagram, Netflix and Facebook (its creator). It’s basically a ready-made code 
            with a predetermined structure and specific way of treating the information and components in 
            the app/page – which many companies find efficient and user-friendly.
